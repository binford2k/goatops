      	<li>Anyone who says, "sounds like someone's got a case of the Mondays!" is liable to get their ass kicked.</li>

      	<li>There are no goat user interface elements that are 'lickable' in any way, shape, or form. Unlesss you're another goat, of course.</li>
        <li>Goatsoft won't sneak into your farm and replace your goats with the latest GoatOS version 10.</li>
        <li>Rebooting a goat means you just kick it harder.</li>
        <li>You never waste time watching your goat compile.</li>
        <li>Goats are much easier to shave than yaks are.</li>
        <li>Goats have never heard of Patch Tuesday.</li>
	<li>Nobody will ever ask you if you've rebooted your goat.</li>
	<li>Goats are basically the OG of continous delivery.</li>
        <li>There are no goats in the cloud.</li>
      	<li>The support escalation policy for your goats is sending the kids out to do their chores.</li>
        <li>Nobody's ever heard of a Goat-to-Butt plugin for Chrome. Yet.</li>
        <li>There's no goat plugin for Splunk; and if you tried to ...<em>plug in</em>..., the goat would probably kick your ass anyway.</li>

        <li>You don't have to monitor the utilization on a goat.</li>
        <li>Milk a goat and the goat stays milked for a while.</li>
        <li>There are no 32-bit goats.</li>
        <li>You don't have to do a demo on a goat. And if you ever do, the goat will do what it's supposed to do and there's not a lot that can keep it from doing it.</li>
        <li>When a goat "goes down", you just bury it and buy a new goat.</li>
        <li>Left alone, Billy goats and Nanny goats do what they're supposed to do. You don't need to format them, monitor them, be on-call for them, step, trace or inspect registers.</li>
        <li>Nobody cares if you're not a Certified Goat Engineer yet.</li>
        <li>When you go back to visit the family, nobody ever asks you to fix their goat while the roast is cooking.</li>

        <li>You can tell whether a goat has been "debugged" by looking at it.</li>
        <li>Goats don't become obsolete. If they do, as long as you didn't neuter them, they make the necessary upgrades themselves.</li>
        <li>The commute time is very short, since the barn is just outside.</li>
        <li>No dress code. Of any kind. EVER.</li>
        <li>You always have the right "file permissions" to milk a goat.</li>
        <li>If a goat gives too many timeout errors, or if performance is generally unacceptable; it just means you're having goat steak for dinner.</li>
        <li>When milking your goats, you either have a bucket or you don't. Nobody tries to sell you on an annual license.</li>
        <li>The bucket either leaks or it doesn't, and it never gets corrupt carrying it out to the barn.</li>
        <li>You don't need to "free up some memory" before you milk a goat.</li>
        <li>You don't need to call a staff meeting to make sure everyone's milking goats the same way.</li>
        <li>Just about any barnyard animal is fault tolerant (except some cows).</li>
        <li>You don't need to sign in with the front desk if you need to milk a goat on a weekend.</li>
        <li>You don't need to worry if you've been spending a lot of time milking what you will later find out to have been an improperly labelled "development goat".</li>

        <li>Carpal tunnel is guaranteed. Don't worry about it.</li>
        <li>A goat has all the "patches" it will ever need. If it doesn't it, just means you're having goat steak for dinner.</li>
        <li>Goats that become full do an automatic "core dump" but they take care of getting themselves reset and on-line. You just have to clean up.</li>
        <li>You do not need to worry about defragmenting or compressing your goat.</li>
        <li>Goats never have to be zipped, archived or converted to Goat-32.</li>
        <li>As long as the stable hasn't caught fire, a goat couldn't care less about a power surge.</li>
        <li>Goats don't have to be backed up at night.</li>
        <li>Each and every one of the parts of a goat use the same interrupt, and the goat works just fine anyway.</li>
        <li>A goat is a goat is a goat.</li>

        <li>Nobody ever needed to draft up a goat-milking requirements document.</li>
        <li>You deliver applications to goats. Goats do not deliver applications to you.</li>
        <li>A goat will do practically anything do get more comfortable. Computers have been known to display the same error message over and over again, all day, without regard to how frequently or how hard the monitor has been hit, slapped, punched or kicked.</li>
        <li>You don't have to log off of a goat and listen to some silly "Exit Goat" sound effect for the next several minutes.</li>
        <li>You won't find out from your next phone bill that you milked your goat too much for your budget.</li>
        <li>On a goat, the <code>SYS$ERR.LOG</code> file is ALWAYS EMPTY.</li>
        <li>Operating systems come & go, but goats will probably never be "orphaned" as they are expected to be produced by their manufacturer for quite some time to come.</li>
        <li>There are no workstation licensing issues with goats.</li>
        <li>You don't get in trouble for milking a goat during business hours, and nobody cares if you reformat it.</li>
        <li>If it's late and you have a lot of goat-milking to do, at least you can see your kids before they have to go to bed. You can probably even make them help you milk your goats.</li>

        <li>Goat security is applied completely, thoroughly, and with all the features you'll ever need, using a stake and a rope.</li>
        <li>Nobody ever got a general protection fault milking a goat.</li>
        <li>You don't need to worry about your whole goat herd locking up if you put an ethernet goat and a token-ring goat together in the same stable.</li>

        <li>You will never be asked to check a box that says, <i>Make this my default goat-milking bucket</i>.</li>
        <li>You do not want, need, or desire in any way for goats to run at a higher clock speed. And they don't.</li>
        <li>You do not need to use a wrist strap to ground yourself before milking, and there's never a need to put your goat in a little plastic baggie. Unless making goat steak.</li>
        <li>There really aren't too many ways to improperly shut down a goat.</li>
        <li>When surrounded by a room full of younger goat farmers, you don't need to worry about dating yourself talking about 300-baud or 4.7-Mhz goats.</li>
        <li>You do not need to buy anything to "uninstall" a goat. Maybe a gun or a knife.</li>
        <li>Once you've filled a bucket with goat milk, the goat can crash and it doesn't matter whether you've "saved" or not. Just don't spill.</li>
        <li>When you buy a new goat, the goat does not need to re-write registry keys on the farm that could have unforeseen effects on the other animals already residing there.</li>
        <li>There are no easter eggs in a goat.</li>
        <li>Goats instinctively know how to "install RAM" by themselves.</li>

        <li>Goats don't need a per-bucket license.</li>

        <li>Goats follow upgrade procedures.</li>
        <li>Goats eat org charts.</li>
        <li>If a goat gets an uncleanable virus, you shoot it.</li>
        <li>If a goat has a non-terminal virus it just does the poo-poo.</li>
        <li>Goats don't need pagers and never get a 'please advise'.</li>

        <li>ISO is not publishing any standards about how you should be farming your goats.</li>
        <li>Counting from zero instead of one doesn't apply to anything goat farmers do and looks stupid. Hexadecimal is unheard of.</li>

        <li>Goat farmer error messages: Goat not found; Goat dead; Goat not awake; Too soon after last milking; Billy goat detected. That's about all. You don't need silly numbers for these, and you don't need to look them up anywhere or check them out at <a href="http://goat.com">goat.com</a>.</li>
        <li>There are no read-only goats. There are no hidden or system goats.</li>
